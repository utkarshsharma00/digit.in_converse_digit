## This project is a part of my Internship at Digit(India's No.1 Technology Magazine) and is an integral part of digit.in which has approximately 20 million+ visitors/month.

A Chatfuel chatbot handling the queries of users visiting on ‘digit.in’. It will also handle the specific use case of Price Queries (across all the products categories available at ‘digit.in’), returning Price & a detailed article about the requested product to the visiting user on the Facebook Messenger platform.  

To achieve this JSON API plugin available in Chatfuel was used in order to post the “customer_query” and then get the desired results from the JSON data. A php script is being run at the backend for this purpose and it also contains the JSON feed. Furthermore the user will also get clickable buttons to buy the product from ‘amazon.in’ and ‘flipkart.com’.
